Server URLs allow your application to **receive data** & **communicate with Interactly** during conversations. Conversation events can include:

- **Status Updates (status-update):** updates on the status of a call
- **Call Updates (conversation-update):** updates on the messages of a call
- **Hang Notifications (hang):** get notified when your assistant fails to reply for a certain amount of time
- **End of Call Report (end-of-call-report):** call summary data at the end of a call

All messages sent to your Server URL will be `POST` requests with the following body:

```json
{
  "message": {
    "type": "status-update",
    "call": { Call Object },
    "assistant": { Assistant Object },
    "phone": { Phone Object },
    "customer": { Customer Object },
    "analysis": { Analysis Object },
    "messages": { Messages Object[] },
    ...other message properties
  }
}
```

They include the type of message, the call object, and any other properties that are relevant to the message type. Below are the different types of messages that can be sent to your Server URL.

### Call Status Updates

During the call, the assistant will make multiple `POST` requests to the Server URL with the following body:

```json
{
  "message": {
    "type": "status-update",
    "status": "ended",
    "call": { Call Object },
  }
}
```

#### Calls Status

A call can have one of the following statuses:

- `trying`: The call has been initiated.
- `early-media`: The call is playing an early media message or tone.
- `ringing`: The recipient's phone is ringing.
- `in-progress`: The call is currently active.
- `busy`: The recipient is unavailable to answer.
- `no-answer`: The call was not answered.
- `failed`: The call attempt was unsuccessful.
- `completed`: The call has ended.

### Conversation Status Updates

During the call, the assistant will make multiple `POST` requests to the Server URL with the following body:

Call Object will include messages also.

```json
{
  "message": {
    "type": "conversation-update",
    "call": { Call Object },
  }
}
```

### Hang Notifications

Whenever the assistant fails to respond for 5+ seconds, the assistant will make a `POST` requests to the Server URL with the following body:

```json
{
  "message": {
    "type": "hang",
    "call": { Call Object },
  }
}
```

### End of Call Report

When a call ends, the assistant will make a `POST` request to the Server URL with the following body:

```json
{
  "message": {
    "type": "end-of-call-report",
    "call": { Call Object },
    "analysis": {
      "summary": "The user picked up the phone then asked about the weather...",
      "successEvaluation": "success",
      "structuredData": {
        "name": "Suresh",
        "age": 29
      }
    },
    "messages":[
      {
        "messageId": "a12f9c88-c155-461f-9771-4d240cdc9a04",
        "text": "Hello! How can I help you?",
        "timestamp": "2020-10-05T10:10:01.000Z",
        "role": "assistant"
      },
      {
        "messageId": "a12f9c88-c155-461f-9771-4d240cdc9a04",
        "text": "What's the weather?",
        "timestamp": "2020-10-05T10:10:02.000Z",
        "role": "user"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

You can use this to display an error message to the user, or to send a notification to your team.

### Tool Calling

<Info>
  Interactly fully supports [OpenAI's function calling
  API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/function-calling), so you can have assistants
  ping your server to perform actions like sending emails, retrieve information, and more.
</Info>

With each response, the assistant will automatically determine what functions to call based on the directions provided in the system message in `messages`. Here's an example of what the assistant might look like:

If you define a tool in the following format and attach it to an assistant, you can use it effectively. [Learn](/webhooks/server-url/setting-server-urls#tool-call)

```json
{
  "name": "sendEmail",
  "description": "Used to send an email to a client.",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "emailAddress": { "type": "string" }
    }
  }
}
```

Once a tool is triggered, the assistant will send a message to your Server URL with the following body:

```json
{
  "emailAddress": "john@example.com"
}
```

Your server should respond with a JSON object containing the function's response, like so:

```json
{ "result": "Your email has been sent." }
```

Or if it's an object:

```json
{
  "result": "{ \"message\": \"Your email has been sent.\", \"email\": \"test@email.com\" }"
}
```

The result will be appended to the conversation, and the assistant will decide what to do with the response based on its system prompt.

<Note>
  If you don't need to return a response, you can use the `async: true` parameter in your assistant's
  tool configuration. This will prevent the assistant from waiting for a response from your
  server.
