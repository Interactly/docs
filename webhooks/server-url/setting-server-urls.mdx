Server URLs can be set at **2 levels** in Interactly:

- **Assistant:** assistants can be configured with a server URL
- **Tool:** Tool calls themselves can have a corresponding server URL

Here's a breakdown of where you can set server URLs in Interactly:

## Assistant

Assistants themselves can have a server URL attached to them.

There are **2 ways** this can be done:

### In the Dashboard
If you go to the [assistant section](https://dashboard.interactly.ai/assistants) of your dashboard, in the **"Advanced"** tab you will see a setting to set the assistant's server URL:

</Frame>

### Via the API
At [assistant creation](/api-reference/assistants/create-assistant) (or via an [update](/api-reference/assistants/update-assistant)) you can set the assistant's server URL.

The server URL for an assistant is stored in the `assistant.server.url` field.

## Tool Call

The most granular level server URLs can be set is at the function call level. This can also be done either in the dashboard, or via code.

### In the Dashboard
In the [tools section](https://dashboard.interactly.ai/tools) of your dashboard, You can define multiple tools and give Server URLs to each of them.

Once tools are defined along with Server URLs, these tools can be attached to an assistant.
If you go to the [assistant section](https://dashboard.interactly.ai/assistants) of your dashboard, in the **"Functions"** tab you will see a setting to select Assistant Tools:

</Frame>

### Via the API

The server URL for a function call can be found on an assistant at `assistant.assistantToolIds`.

You can either set the URL for a function call at [tool creation](/api-reference/tools/create-tool), or in an [tool update](/api-reference/tools/update-tool).

The selected tools along with their server urls for an assistant is stored in the `assistant.assistantToolServers` field.
