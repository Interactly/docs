## Overview

Verification calls involve several steps to ensure seamless and accurate processing. This document outlines the flow, statuses, and transitions that occur during these calls.

---

## Major Steps in the Process

1. **Initiating Calls**:
   - Clients can raise verification calls using either of the following APIs:
     - **Individual call API** ([Reference](/api-reference/calls/create-enquiry-call))
     - **Batch calls API** ([Reference](/api-reference/calls/create-batch-enquiry-calls))

2. **Request Handling**:
   - Interactly receives all incoming requests and adds them to a processing queue.
   - Immediate responses are sent to clients acknowledging the receipt of requests.

3. **Verification and Processing**:
   - Calls are processed and verified in the background.
   - Status updates for each call are provided via the callback URL (if specified by the client).

## Call Status Flow

The lifecycle of a call is represented by the following status transitions:

`received` -> `ready` -> `queued` -> `ringing` -> `processing` -> `ended` -> `completed` / `failed`

---

### Status Descriptions and Transitions

#### 1. **received**
   - **Definition**: Initial status for all incoming calls.
   - **Next Step**: Calls move to `ready` after basic validation.

#### 2. **received -> ready**
   - **Validation Process**:
     - Calls in `received` status undergo basic validation to ensure all required fields are present.
     - **Successful Validation**: Status changes to `ready`.
     - **Validation Errors**: Status changes to `failed` with an appropriate error code and message indicating the issue.

#### 3. **ready -> queued**
   - **Verification Process**:
     - Calls in `ready` status are checked against provider/user preference timings.
     - **Within Preferred Timing**: Status changes to `queued`.
     - **Outside Preferred Timing**: Status remains `ready` and is reattempted in the next processing cycle.

#### 4. **queued -> ringing**
   - **Call Initiation**:
     - Calls in `queued` status are assigned to available assistant call handlers.
     - **Successful Connection**: Status changes to `ringing`.
     - **Failure Cases**:
       - Invalid phone number
       - Unanswered calls
       - Status changes to `failed` with relevant error codes and reasons.

#### 5. **ringing -> processing**
   - **Active Call**:
     - Status changes to `processing` once the call is answered by the provider or user.

#### 6. **processing -> ended**
   - **Call Completion**:
     - Status changes to `ended` when the conversation ends (either by the assistant or the provider/user).

#### 7. **ended -> completed / failed**
   - **Final Analysis**:
     - Calls in `ended` status undergo post-call analysis to determine success or failure.
     - **Completed**: Indicates successful call completion with collected information stored.
     - **Failed**: Indicates failure, with error codes and messages logged for reference.

---

## Final Status

Each call concludes with one of the following statuses:

- **completed**:
  - Indicates a successful call.
  - Information collected during the call is saved.

- **failed**:
  - Indicates a failure at any stage.
  - Relevant error details are recorded.
