    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Campaign Configuration

### Campaign Type Selection
Select **Single-Modal** to create voice-only campaigns:

<Card title="Single-Modal Benefits" icon="phone">
  - **Voice calls only** - no messaging complexity
  - **Streamlined setup** - focus purely on call configuration
  - **Cost-effective** - no SMS charges
  - **Simple workflow** - one communication channel
</Card>

<Note>
  Need SMS capabilities? Create a [Multi-Modal Campaign](/campaigns/multi-modal-campaign) instead.
</Note>

### Assistant Configuration

<Accordion title="Select Assistant Number">
  Choose your AI assistant from the dropdown menu. This determines:
  - **Phone number** used for outbound calls
  - **AI model** and voice configuration
  - **Conversation flow** and response patterns
  - **Voice characteristics** and speaking style
</Accordion>

### Notification Settings

<Card title="Email Notifications" icon="mail">
  Add your email address to receive:
  - Campaign launch confirmations
  - Real-time status updates
  - Error alerts and warnings
  - Final completion reports
</Card>

<Tip>
  Press **Enter** after typing your email to confirm it's properly added to the notification list.
</Tip>

### Schedule Configuration

#### Time Zone Settings
- **Default**: America/New York
- **Customizable**: Select from available time zones
- **Important**: Affects all call timing in your campaign

#### Campaign Timing
Configure flexible scheduling for your voice calls with multiple dates and custom timings:

<Info>
  You can schedule campaigns across multiple dates, each with their own start and end times for maximum flexibility.
</Info>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Multiple Dates Support" icon="calendar-days">
    **Flexible Date Selection**
    - Add multiple target dates for your campaign
    - Each date can have different timing windows
    - Perfect for multi-day outreach sequences
  </Card>

  <Card title="Custom Daily Timing" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    **Individual Day Control**
    - Set unique start/end times per date
    - No requirement for consistent timing
    - Adapt to different time zones or business hours
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

#### How Campaign Timing Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Schedule Multiple Dates">
    Add as many campaign dates as needed, each with custom timing windows

    <Card title="Example Schedule" icon="calendar">
      - **Day 1**: January 15, 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM
      - **Day 2**: January 16, 2:00 PM - 8:00 PM
      - **Day 3**: January 20, 10:00 AM - 3:00 PM
    </Card>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Automatic Progression">
    Campaign moves through scheduled dates in sequence, making calls during each time window
  </Step>

  <Step title="Smart Completion">
    Campaign ends when **either** condition is met:
    - ✅ All calls reach their final stage (completed/failed)
    - ✅ All scheduled dates and times have passed
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Accordion title="Campaign Completion Logic">
  **Important**: If your campaign completes all calls before reaching later scheduled dates, those remaining dates will be skipped automatically.

  **Example**: If you schedule 3 days but all contacts are successfully called on day 1, days 2 and 3 won't execute.

  This ensures efficient resource usage and prevents unnecessary processing.
</Accordion>

<Tip>
  Use multiple dates with different timings to accommodate varying contact preferences, time zones, or business operating hours.
</Tip>

### Call Volume Management

<Accordion title="Max Parallel Calls">
  Control how many simultaneous calls your campaign can make:

  <Warning>
    Your maximum parallel calls cannot exceed your organization's license limit. Check your limits before setting this value.
  </Warning>

  **To verify your organization limits:**
  1. Navigate to **My Organization** → **License**
  2. Review your org limit set by the Interactly team
  3. Configure max parallel calls within this limit

  <Frame caption="Organization limits">
    <img src="/images/campaigns/org-limit.png" />
  </Frame>
</Accordion>

## Webhook Integration

Webhooks allow your application to receive real-time updates about campaign and call statuses. This enables you to build custom integrations and automated workflows.

### Webhook Configuration

<Card title="Webhook URL" icon="globe">
  The endpoint where Interactly will send webhook notifications
</Card>

<Card title="Webhook Secret" icon="key">
  Optional security header (`x-interactly-secret`) to verify webhook authenticity

## Contact Data Upload

For single-modal campaigns, you only need contact data relevant to voice calls.
To upload the file with records first download the sample file.

### **Sample file for Voice-Only Campaigns**:

<Info>
  Since this is a single-modal campaign, focus on data needed for voice interactions only
</Info>

- **phone_number** (mandatory): The primary field - the number to call
- **Voice prompt variables**: Fields used as dynamic variables in your AI assistant's voice prompts
- **Call-relevant data**: Information your assistant needs during the voice conversation
- You can add as many contact records as needed
- All voice prompt variables must be populated
- Once the file is ready, click upload to add your contacts
- Missing required fields will prevent upload - you can **delete** and re-upload if needed

<Frame caption="">

## When to Choose Single-Modal vs Multi-Modal

### Choose Single-Modal Campaigns When:
- ✅ You only need voice interactions
- ✅ Simple appointment reminders or confirmations
- ✅ Quick surveys or data collection calls
- ✅ Direct customer service interactions
- ✅ Streamlined workflow is preferred
- ✅ No messaging requirements

### Choose Multi-Modal Campaigns When:
- 📱 You need pre-call SMS notifications
- 📱 Post-call follow-up messages are required
- 📱 Complex multi-step communication flows
- 📱 Document or link sharing is needed
- 📱 Mixed communication preferences in your audience

<Note>
  If you're unsure, start with single-modal for simplicity. You can always create a multi-modal campaign later if you need messaging capabilities.
</Note>
