### The Web Dashboard

One of the simplest ways to get started with Interactly is by using the web dashboard.

<Note>
You can visit our dashboard by going to [dashboard.interactly.ai](https://dashboard.interactly.ai)
</Note>

The web dashboard gives you the ability to:

- **view, create, & modify [assistants](https://dashboard.interactly.ai/assistants)** associated with your account
- **provision & manage [phone numbers](https://dashboard.interactly.ai/phone)** Assistants can make outbound calls or receive inbound calls
- **review [conversation data](https://dashboard.interactly.ai/conversations)** (such as audio recordings, call metadata, etc)
