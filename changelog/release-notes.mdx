## What's new in v1.3.0

🚀 Updates & Improvements

### 🔧 External API Tools - Full HTTP Method Support

**Enhanced API Integration Capabilities**

External API Tools now support all standard HTTP methods, providing complete flexibility for integrating with third-party services and APIs.

#### What's Changed

**Before:** Only `POST` method was supported by default for External API Tools.

**Now:** Full support for all HTTP methods:
- `GET` - Retrieve data from APIs
- `POST` - Create new resources
- `PUT` - Update existing resources completely
- `PATCH` - Partial updates to existing resources
- `DELETE` - Remove resources

#### How to Use

1. Navigate to the **Tools Section** in your dashboard
2. Create or edit an External API Tool
3. Select your desired HTTP method from the dropdown
4. Configure the tool parameters as needed
5. Attach the tool to your assistant

This enhancement enables more sophisticated integrations with REST APIs, allowing your assistants to perform comprehensive CRUD operations and interact with a wider range of external services.

### 📚 Knowledge Base Optimization

**Improved Query Performance and Indexing**

* **Enhanced Query Processing** - Optimized algorithms for faster knowledge base searches and more accurate results
* **Advanced Indexing** - Improved indexing mechanisms that reduce response times and enhance search relevance
* **Better Scalability** - Enhanced performance for larger knowledge bases with more documents and data

These improvements result in faster knowledge retrieval during conversations and more accurate responses from your assistants.

### 🎤 ElevenLabs Configuration Enhancement

**New Streaming Latency Control**

We've added granular control over ElevenLabs streaming optimization, giving you more precise control over the balance between quality and latency.

#### New Configuration Field

```javascript
// New configurable field in ElevenLabs TTS settings
optimizeStreamingLatency: Number // Range: 0 (max quality) to 4 (max speed)
```

#### Configuration Details

* **Field Name:** `optimizeStreamingLatency`
* **Value Range:** `0` to `4`
* **New Default:** `0` (previously managed internally with value `3`)
* **Configuration Methods:**
  - Dashboard UI toggle
  - API configuration support

#### Latency Optimization Levels

- **`0`** - Maximum quality, higher latency (recommended for most use cases)
- **`1-2`** - Balanced quality and latency
- **`3`** - Previous default - good balance
- **`4`** - Maximum speed, optimized for real-time interactions

<Callout type="info">
  **Migration Note**: Existing configurations will automatically use the new default value of `0`. If you were relying on the previous behavior, you may want to set this to `3` to maintain the same performance characteristics.

* **`digitalGainControl`** - Controls Digital Gain Control (DGC) for automatic volume adjustment
* **`knobValue`** - Fine-tune suppression intensity from 0 (minimal) to 100 (maximum)

#### Migration Guide

**Before:**
```javascript
{
  noiseSuppressor: true,
  noiseSuppressionKnob: 80
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
{
  noiseSuppressorConfig: {
    enabled: true,
    suppressBackgroundNoise: true,
    suppressBackgroundVoice: false,
    digitalGainControl: true,
    knobValue: 80
  }

## What's new in v1.0.0

### 1. Enable Debug mode (see **Enable Debug mode** section below)

Quickly turn on verbose developer logs from your profile so you can inspect detailed runtime information when diagnosing issues. When Debug mode is enabled the dashboard surfaces expanded logs and error traces useful for developers during troubleshooting.

See the [**Enable Debug mode**](#enable-debug-mode) section below for more details.

### 2. TTS — new audio cache scopes (assistant & team) + clip deletion

We added two new cache scope levels for TTS audio clips — **assistant** and **team** — so generated audio can be cached at the most appropriate scope for reuse and cost savings. The dashboard now also exposes the ability to delete existing audio clips so you can manage storage and refresh voices or content when needed.

### 3. Campaign Webhooks

You can now register webhooks to receive real-time notifications for important campaign lifecycle events (for example: campaign completion) and per-call status updates (for example: call completed, failed, or dropped). Webhooks may be configured when **creating** or **updating** a campaign, enabling easy integration with downstream systems and automation pipelines.

### 4. Twilio SMS — Inbound & Outbound

Dashboard toggle to enable Twilio SMS inbound and outbound functionality. This makes two-way SMS possible so your flows can receive replies and send messages via Twilio directly from the dashboard — useful for bi-directional support and conversational workflows.

### 5. Vonage Number management

Buy or import Vonage phone numbers directly from the dashboard. Note: you will need to provide your Vonage credentials when adding or importing numbers.

### 6. Fixed: missed tool calls and trailing messages

Resolved a bug where tool calls and messages at the end of conversations could be missed or dropped. This fix improves reliability for trailing-message flows and integrations that depend on final tool outputs.

### 7. Stability & performance improvements

General reliability and performance upgrades across the platform — faster page loads, reduced error rates, and smoother dashboard interactions.
