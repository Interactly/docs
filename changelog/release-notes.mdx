  ## Campaigns improvements

  ### **Webhooks** for campaign events

  You can now set up webhooks to get notified about important campaign events such as completion of campaigns and each call status like completed or failed. 
  This allows you to integrate campaign events with your existing systems and workflows.

  Webhooks can be configured when [creating](/api-reference/campaigns/campaigns/create-campaigns#body-webhook) or [updating](/api-reference/campaigns/campaigns/patch-campaign-with-id) a campaign.

  Check the [campaign webhooks documentation](/api-reference/campaigns/campaigns/create-campaigns#body-webhook) to learn how to set up webhooks for your campaigns.
