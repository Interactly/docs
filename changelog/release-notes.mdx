### 🎵 Hold-Call Tag Support

**Pause Calls with Custom Hold Music**

Custom LLM workflows can now trigger call holds with configurable hold music using the hold-call tag. This is useful for scenarios where you need to pause a call and play background music.

#### How to Use

Add the following XML tag to your custom LLM response:

```xml
<hold_call/><play_type>keyboard</play_type><play_duration>0.5</play_duration>
```

#### Configuration Details

* **`<hold_call/>`** - Triggers the hold state
* **`<play_type>`** - Type of hold music (e.g., `keyboard`, `music`)
* **`<play_duration>`** - Duration in seconds to play hold audio

When the hold-call tag is detected, the call will be paused and hold music will be played for the specified duration before the call resumes.


### 🔍 Search KB and Assistants by ID

**Resource Discovery by Object ID**

Our dashboard portal now supports searching for knowledge bases, assistants, and workflows by their object IDs, in addition to existing search by name and description.
