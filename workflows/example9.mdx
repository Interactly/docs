## High-Level Description

This workflow introduces two advanced features that enhance user experience and enable cross-node data flow: **Tool Static Messages** and **Tool Result Runtime Variables**. Static messages provide user feedback during tool execution ("Analyzing your symptoms..."), while runtime variables store tool results for use in downstream agents. The example demonstrates a patient triage workflow where symptom assessment results are stored and used by specialized care path agents.

## New Concepts Introduced
Building upon Examples 1-8, this workflow adds:
1. **Tool Static Messages** (static messages **in tools**):
    - Display messages to users while tools execute
    - Provide feedback during potentially long operations
    - Improve perceived responsiveness
    - Set user expectations
2. **Tool Result Runtime Variables** (result_runtime_variable_name):
    - Store tool return values in named variables
    - Access stored values in downstream agent prompts
    - Enable data flow between agents without structured output schemas
    - Use template syntax: [[variable_name.field]]
3. **Edge Static Messages** (static_messages **in edges**):
    - Display messages during transitions between agents
    - Inform users about routing decisions
    - Provide context for workflow progression
4. **Liquid Template Filters in Expressions**:
    - [[variable | upcase]]: Convert to uppercase
    - Enables case-insensitive comparisons 
    - Useful for enum validation

 ```
### What Happens:
 1. User provides symptoms
 2. Agent calls assess_patient_symptoms()
 3. **User sees**: "Let me analyze your symptoms..." (static message)
 4. Tool executes and returns assessment dict
 5. Result stored in patient_assessment_result runtime variable
 6. Result available to all downstream agents

## Agent Details

## Agent 1: Greeting Agent

**Purpose**: Welcome patient to virtual triage.

**Prompt**:"Welcome the patient warmly in less than 15 words. Let them know you're here to help assess their symptoms and guide them to the right care." 

----
## Agent 2: Triage Assessment Agent
**Purpose**: Gather symptom information and call assessment tool.
**Configuration**:
 - **Tools**: patient_assessment_tools (contains assess_patient_symptoms) 
 - **Max Consecutive Tool Calls**: 3
 - **Prompt** (Key Points):

```Text
  You are a compassionate Virtual Triage Agent helping patients get the right care.

 YOUR SPECIFIC ROLE:
 1. Gather information about patient symptoms conversationally
 2. Use the assess_patient_symptoms tool to determine urgency
 3. Provide clear guidance based on the assessment

 GATHERING INFORMATION - Ask about:
 - What symptoms they're experiencing
 - How long they've had these symptoms
 - How severe the symptoms are (mild, moderate, severe)

 IMPORTANT - TOOL USAGE:
 - Once you have symptoms, duration, and severity, ALWAYS call assess_patient_symptoms
 - The tool will show a "Let me analyze..." message while it works
 - Use the tool result to guide your response
```
### Tool Usage Flow:
 1. Asks about symptoms, duration, severity
 2. Calls assess_patient_symptoms() when info collected
 3. **User sees static messages during execution**
 4. Tool result stored in patient_assessment_result
 5. Agent uses result to provide guidance

## Agent 3: Emergency Care Agent
**Purpose**: Provide emergency care instructions for critical cases.
**Configuration**:
 - **Prompt** (Uses Runtime Variables) ⭐: 
```text
You are an internal agent handling an EMERGENCY case, specialized in providing immediate care instructions.

You have been given the following assessment about the patient's condition:
Urgency Level: [[patient_assessment_result.urgency_level]]
Symptoms: [[patient_assessment_result.symptoms_summary]]
Recommendation: [[patient_assessment_result.recommendation]]

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Immediately emphasize the urgency
2. Provide clear emergency instructions (call 911 or go to ER)
3. Do NOT schedule appointments - this is an emergency
4. Reassure the patient that emergency care is available 24/7
```
**How Runtime Variables Work in Prompts**:
 - [[patient_assessment_result.urgency_level]] → Replaced with "EMERGENCY"
 - [[patient_assessment_result.symptoms_summary]] → Replaced with actual symptoms
 - [[patient_assessment_result.recommendation]] → Replaced with recommendation text
 - Agent has context from tool execution without re-asking

----
## Agent 4: Urgent Care Agent
**Purpose**: Handle urgent (but not emergency) cases.

**Prompt with Runtime Variables**:

```Text
  You are an internal agent handling an URGENT care case.

You have been given the following assessment:
Urgency Level: [[patient_assessment_result.urgency_level]]
Symptoms: [[patient_assessment_result.symptoms_summary]]
Duration: [[patient_assessment_result.duration]]
Recommendation: [[patient_assessment_result.recommendation]]

YOUR TASKS:
1. Acknowledge their symptoms with empathy
2. Explain that urgent care is the right level of service
3. Help them get care quickly (within 24 hours)
```
## Agent 5: Routine Care Agent
**Purpose**: Handle non-urgent cases.

**Prompt with Runtime Variables**:
```Text
  You are an internal agent handling a ROUTINE care case.

Based on the assessment:
Urgency Level: [[patient_assessment_result.urgency_level]]
Symptoms: [[patient_assessment_result.symptoms_summary]]
Recommendation: [[patient_assessment_result.recommendation]]

YOUR TASKS:
1. Reassure the patient that their symptoms don't require urgent attention
2. Tell them to schedule a routine appointment
3. Be reassuring while taking their concerns seriously
```
## Agent 6: End Conversation (Global)
**Purpose**: Exit point from any agent.  

**Type**: Static Message (Global) **Messages**:
 - "Thank you for using our Virtual Triage Assistant. Take care and feel better soon!"
 - "We're here whenever you need us. Wishing you good health!"

## Conversation Flow Details

## Transition 1: Greeting to Triage

**Type**: Direct Edge**Description**: "After greeting, begin the triage assessment process"

----
## Transition 2: Triage to Emergency Care (with Edge Static Message)
**Type**: Conditional Edge (Expression)  
### Condition Expression ⭐:
```Json
  [[patient_assessment_result.urgency_level | upcase]] == 'EMERGENCY'
  ```
### Explanation:
 - [[patient_assessment_result.urgency_level]]: Access runtime variable
 - | upcase: Liquid template filter (converts to uppercase)
 - == 'EMERGENCY': Compare against uppercase string
 - Ensures case-insensitive matching
### Static Message (During Transition) ⭐:
```Json
  {
  "static_messages": ["Routing you to emergency care guidance..."]
  }
```
### User Experience:
 1. Tool static message: "Assessing the urgency of your case..."
 2. Tool completes, urgency determined to be EMERGENCY
 3. **Edge static message**: "Routing you to emergency care guidance..." 
 4. Emergency Care Agent responds with instructions
----
## Transition 3: Triage to Urgent Care
**Type**: Conditional Edge (Expression)  

**Condition Expression**: 
```Text
  [[patient_assessment_result.urgency_level | upcase]] == 'URGENT'
```
### Static Message:
```Json
  {
  "static_messages": ["Connecting you to urgent care scheduling..."]
  }
```
## Transition 4: Triage to Routine Care
**Type**: Conditional Edge (Expression)  
### Condition Expression:
```Text
  [[patient_assessment_result.urgency_level | upcase]] == 'ROUTINE'
```
### Static Message:
```Json
  {
  "static_messages": ["Setting up routine care options for you..."]
  }
```
## Complete Workflow Execution Examples
## Example 1: Emergency Case with Static Messages
```Text
  [Workflow Starts]

Greeting: "Welcome! I'm here to help assess your symptoms and guide you to the right care."

→ [Transition to Triage]

Triage: "Tell me what symptoms you're experiencing."

User: "I'm having severe chest pain and trouble breathing for the last 30 minutes"

Triage: "How would you rate the severity - mild, moderate, or severe?"

User: "Severe"

→ Agent calls assess_patient_symptoms(
    symptoms="severe chest pain and trouble breathing",
    duration="30 minutes",
    severity="severe"
  )

→ USER SEES (Static Messages from Tool):
   "Let me analyze your symptoms..."
   "Evaluating your condition..."
   "Assessing the urgency of your case..."

→ Tool Returns:
   {
     "urgency_level": "EMERGENCY",
     "care_path": "emergency_room",
     "wait_time": "immediate",
     "recommendation": "Seek emergency care immediately - call 911 or go to nearest ER",
     "symptoms_summary": "severe chest pain and trouble breathing",
     "severity": "severe",
     "duration": "30 minutes"
   }

→ Stored in: patient_assessment_result

→ Expression Check: 
   [[patient_assessment_result.urgency_level | upcase]] == 'EMERGENCY'
   "EMERGENCY" | upcase = "EMERGENCY"
   "EMERGENCY" == "EMERGENCY" = TRUE ✅

→ USER SEES (Static Message from Edge):
   "Routing you to emergency care guidance..."

→ [Transition to Emergency Care Agent]

Emergency Care: "🚨 This is an EMERGENCY situation. Based on your severe chest pain and trouble breathing, you need immediate medical attention. Please call 911 right now or go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do not wait. Emergency care is available 24/7 for situations like yours."

[Workflow effectively ends - emergency escalation complete]
```
## Example 2: Urgent Case Flow
```Text
Triage: "What symptoms are you experiencing?"

User: "I've had a high fever (102°F) and I'm vomiting for the past 2 days. It feels moderate in severity."

→ Agent calls assess_patient_symptoms(
    symptoms="high fever 102F and vomiting",
    duration="2 days",
    severity="moderate"
  )

→ USER SEES:
   "Let me analyze your symptoms..."
   "Evaluating your condition..."

→ Tool Returns and Stores:
   patient_assessment_result = {
     "urgency_level": "URGENT",
     "care_path": "urgent_care",
     "symptoms_summary": "high fever 102F and vomiting",
     "duration": "2 days",
     "recommendation": "Visit urgent care or schedule same-day appointment"
   }

→ Expression Check: urgency_level == "URGENT" → TRUE ✅

→ USER SEES (Edge Message):
   "Connecting you to urgent care scheduling..."

→ [Transition to Urgent Care Agent]

Urgent Care: "I understand you've been dealing with a high fever (102°F) and vomiting for 2 days. This needs prompt attention. Let me help you schedule an urgent care visit within the next 24 hours. We have same-day appointments available. Would morning or afternoon work better for you?"

[Continues with scheduling flow]
```
## Example 3: Routine Case
```Json
User: "I've had a mild headache for a few days, nothing too serious"

→ Tool Call: assess_patient_symptoms("mild headache", "few days", "mild")

→ USER SEES:
   "Let me analyze your symptoms..."

→ Tool Stores:
   patient_assessment_result = {
     "urgency_level": "ROUTINE",
     "symptoms_summary": "mild headache",
     "duration": "few days",
     "recommendation": "Schedule routine appointment with your primary care provider"
   }

→ Expression: urgency_level == "ROUTINE" → TRUE ✅

→ USER SEES (Edge Message):
   "Setting up routine care options for you..."

→ [Transition to Routine Care]

Routine Care: "Thank you for sharing. A mild headache for a few days doesn't require urgent attention. I recommend scheduling a routine appointment with your primary care provider within the next 1-2 weeks. This will give you a chance to discuss your symptoms and get a proper evaluation. Would you like help scheduling that appointment?"

[Continues with routine scheduling]
```

## Key Takeaways

### Tool Static Messages:
 - Provide real-time feedback during tool execution
 - Improve user experience with progress updates
 - Set expectations ("Analyzing...", "Calculating...")
 - Can include multiple messages for longer operations
 - Displayed in order while tool runs
### Tool Result Runtime Variables:
 - Store tool return values in named variables
 - Access in downstream agent prompts using [[variable_name.field]]
 - Enable data flow without structured output schemas
 - Cleaner than passing data through conversation context
 - Available to all subsequent agents in the workflow
### Edge Static Messages:

 - Display during transitions between agents
 - Inform users about routing decisions
 - Provide context for workflow progression
 - Examples: "Routing to specialist...", "Processing your request..."
### Liquid Template Filters:

 - | upcase: Convert to uppercase
 - | downcase: Convert to lowercase
 - Useful for case-insensitive comparisons
 - Applied in expression conditions
### Benefits:

 - **User Experience**: Transparent, responsive interactions
 - **Data Flow**: Clean cross-agent data sharing
 - **Flexibility**: Tool results accessible anywhere downstream
 - **Debugging**: Easy to trace data flow through runtime variables
 ### Use Cases:

 - **Medical Triage**: Assessment results guide care path
 - **Financial Applications**: Credit checks inform product offerings
 - **Customer Service**: Account lookup results customize responses
 - **E-commerce**: Inventory checks determine availability messaging
 - **Form Validation**: Validation results shown during multi-step processes
### Comparison to Previous Examples:
 - Example 8: Inline tools (no static messages or runtime vars)
 - Example 9: Adds tool static messages AND runtime variables
 - Enables richer user experience and cleaner data flow
### Technical Flow:
```Text
 1. Agent calls tool with arguments
 2. USER SEES: Tool static messages
 3. Tool executes and returns result
 4. Result stored in runtime variable
 5. Conditional edge evaluates using runtime variable
 6. USER SEES: Edge static message (during transition)
 7. Destination agent uses runtime variable in prompt
 8. Destination agent responds with context from tool resul
```
### Best Practices:
 - Use descriptive static messages
 - Store comprehensive tool results
 - Access specific fields with dot notation
 - Use filters for robust comparisons
 - Provide edge messages for clarity
 
This workflow demonstrates how static messages and runtime variables create seamless, context-aware conversational experiences while maintaining clean data flow across agents.
