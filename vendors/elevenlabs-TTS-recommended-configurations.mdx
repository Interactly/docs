  </Card>
  <Card title="Turbo v2.5" icon="gauge-high">
    Balanced quality and speed
  </Card>

</CardGroup>

### Flash v2.5

**Best for:** Real-time applications requiring ultra-low latency

**Use cases:** 
- Agents Platform
- Interactive applications
- Games requiring immediate response
- Large-scale processing

**Key benefits:**
- ~75ms latency
- 32 languages supported
- 40,000 character limit
- 50% lower price per character

<Warning>
Numbers aren't normalized by default. Consider using the `apply_text_normalization` parameter (Enterprise only) or have your LLM normalize text beforehand.
</Warning>

#### Understanding Text Normalization

Text normalization converts text into a format that sounds more natural when spoken aloud. Without it, certain elements can be mispronounced or sound unnatural.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Phone Number Normalization">
    **Input:** `123-456-7890`
    
    **Without normalization:** "one hundred twenty-three dash four hundred fifty-six dash seven thousand eight hundred ninety"
    
    **With normalization:** "one two three, four five six, seven eight nine zero"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Date Normalization">
    **Input:** `2024-01-01`
    
    **Without normalization:** "two thousand twenty-four dash zero one dash zero one"
    
    **With normalization:** "January first, two thousand twenty-four"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Time Normalization">
    **Input:** `14:30`
    
    **Without normalization:** "fourteen colon thirty"
    
    **With normalization:** "two thirty PM"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

**Model-specific normalization handling:**

- **Multilingual v2:** Better at automatic normalization
- **Flash v2.5/Turbo v2.5:** Numbers aren't normalized by default for speed
- **Enterprise users:** Can enable `apply_text_normalization` parameter for v2.5 models

<Tip>
For best results with Flash models, preprocess your text using LLM prompts or regular expressions to normalize these elements before sending to TTS.
</Tip>

### Turbo v2.5

**Best for:** Balanced quality and speed applications

**Use cases:** When you need higher quality than Flash but can accept slightly higher latency (~250-300ms)

**Key benefits:**
- High quality voice generation
- 32 languages supported
- 40,000 character limit
- 50% lower price per character

**Ideal when:** You want Flash v2.5 use cases but prioritize quality over maximum speed

### Flash v2

**Best for:** English-only real-time applications

**Use cases:**
- Agents Platform (English only)
- Interactive English applications

**Key benefits:**
- ~75ms latency
- 30,000 character limit

<Info>
**Limitation:** English only
</Info>

### Turbo v2

**Best for:** English-only balanced quality and speed

**Use cases:** High-quality English voice generation with low latency

**Key benefits:**
- ~250-300ms latency
- 30,000 character limit

<Info>
**Limitation:** English only
</Info>

## Voice Settings

### Speaker Boost

Speaker Boost enhances similarity to the original speaker, making the generated voice sound more like the source voice used for cloning.

**Trade-offs:**
- ✅ **Benefits:** Increased similarity to the original speaker
- ❌ **Costs:** Higher computational load, increased latency
- 📊 **Impact:** Generally produces subtle differences

**When to use:**
- Maximum similarity to the original voice is required
- Latency is not a critical concern
- Working with voices where subtle improvements are noticeable
- High-quality, non-real-time applications

**When to avoid:**
- Real-time applications (like Agents Platform)
- Using Flash models for low-latency needs
- Computational cost outweighs the subtle benefits

### Stability

Controls the consistency and emotional variability of the voice generation.

### Similarity

Determines how closely the AI adheres to the original voice.

### Style Exaggeration

Amplifies the speaking style of the original voice.

### Seed

The seed value controls variations that ElevenLabs can generate for a single utterance, ranging from `0` to `4294967295`.

<Note>
According to ElevenLabs documentation: "If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically, such that repeated requests with the same seed and parameters should return the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed."
</Note>

<Warning>
With many possible variations for the same utterance, there's always a chance that some variations may sound unnatural.
</Warning>

## Recommended Settings

### Model Selection

- ✅ **Use v2.5 models** over v2 for multilingual support and higher character limits
- ⚡ **Choose Flash** for maximum speed (with slightly reduced quality)
- 🎯 **Choose Turbo** for better quality with acceptable latency
- 📝 Text normalization is not needed for v2 models; v2.5 models may need this option enabled

### Voice Settings Configuration

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Speaker Boost" icon="volume-high">
    **Recommendation:** Disabled by default
    
    Enable only if similarity isn't sufficient and you can accept the latency increase.
    
    *Applies to all models*
  </Card>

  <Card title="Stability" icon="balance-scale">
    **Recommendation:** Start around `50`
    
    This provides a balanced middle ground for consistency.
    
    *Applies to all models*
  </Card>

  <Card title="Similarity" icon="copy">
    **Recommendation:** Start around `75`
    
    Suitable for most use cases to balance quality and performance.
    
    *Applies to all models*
  </Card>

  <Card title="Style Exaggeration" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    **Recommendation:** Keep at `0` most of the time
    
    Only increase if you need amplified speaking style.
    
    *Applies to all models*
  </Card>

  <Card title="Seed" icon="dice">
    **Recommendation:** Use with caution
    
    Be aware that with many variations possible, some may sound unnatural.
