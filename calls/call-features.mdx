Interactly offers a main feature that provide enhanced control over live calls:

## Call Control

This feature allows you to inject conversation elements dynamically during an ongoing call.

To use these features, you first need to obtain the URLs specific to the live call. These URLs can be retrieved by triggering a `/calls` endpoint, which returns the `controlUrl` within the `monitor` object.

## Obtaining URLs for Call Control

Initiate a call and retrieve the `controlUrl`, send a POST request to the `/calls/v1/conversations` endpoint. [Create Call API](/api-reference/calls/create-call)

### Sample Request

```bash
curl 'https://api-prod.interactly.ai/calls/v1/conversations'
-H 'authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' 
-H 'content-type: application/json' 
--data-raw '{
  "assistantId": "5b0a4a08-133c-4146-9315-0984f8c6be80",
  "customer": {
    "number": "+12345678913"
  },
  "phoneNumberId": "42b4b25d-031e-4786-857f-63b346c9580f"
}'
```

### Sample Response

```json

    "id": "a12f9c88-c155-461f-9771-4d240cdc9a04",

    },
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "text": "Hello! How can I help you?",
            "timestamp": "2020-10-05T00:00:00.000Z"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Call Control Feature

Once you have the `controlUrl`, you can inject a message into the live call using a POST request. This can be done by sending a JSON payload to the `controlUrl`.

Following call control features we support currently

1. **say** - To speak a message
2. **end** - To end the call
3. **forward** - To forward the call
4. **dtmf** - To enter DTMF code

Depending on the type of control you want to make over a call, schema will be different to provide additional information. Refer [Control Call API](/api-reference/calls/control-call)

### Example: Injecting a Message

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api-prod.interactly.ai/calls/v1/convesations/7420f27a-30fd-4f49-a995-5549ae7cc00d/control'
-H 'content-type: application/json' 
--data-raw '{
  "type": "say",
  "message": "Welcome to Interactly, this message was injected during the call."
}'

```

The message will be spoken in real-time during the ongoing call.
